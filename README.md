Survey simulations v2.1


## baseline

## ddf_accourd

Runs where we try running the DDF fields with "accourdian" cadence, e.g., low cadence, high cadence, low cadence during the observing season. In this group we vary the season length and the fraction of time given to low nad high cadence observations.

## ddf_1

We have one set where we vary the season length. Another set where we cut the DDF sequence in half and double the cadence (and then vary the cadence as before).  

## good_seeing

Testing what happens if we try to get N "good seeing" observations in certain filters every year.
