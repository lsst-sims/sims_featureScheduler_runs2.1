#Outstanding Questions#

Some notes on the remaining survey strategy questions that need to be answered

## Footprints ##

Any final adjustments to the footprint. Changes to the bulge/galactic plane?

## Rolling ##

The baseline uses a half-sky rolling strategy. 

* Should there be rolling in other regions? (dusty plane, bulge, etc)
* Should we go for an "extra season" of rolling, even if it impacts proper motion? 
    * Might be worth considering potential for after 10 years. The astrometry penalty fades if the survey goes longer. OTOH, never get a chance to anchor those early observations again, so maybe better to say we'll do more rolling later if another year gets added.

## Magellenic Clouds ##

Seems like doing something facier with the LMC and SMC would be nice.

## Filter Distribution ##

I would like some more justification for our filter distributions on different parts of the footprint.
